# Sequencer

We use `Sequencer` to manage the execution of the render tasks. In Sequencer, 
you can manage almost every thing (Actor) in the scene, including `Camera`, `Light`, 
`StaticMesh`, `SkeletalMesh`, `Volumetric`. And for each actor, you can get every component
in the actor, and set properties of the actor and its components, 
e.g. `CameraComponent.FieldOfView`, `Transform`, `Animation`, `Material`, etc.
